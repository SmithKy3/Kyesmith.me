## University of Sheffield's Electronic and Electrical Engineering Society Logo
#### what a mouthful

In my final year of University, my course's society decided to host a competition
to have a student redesign their logo. So, I loaded up photoshop and spent a day on my
design (great way to procrastinate). As luck would have it, I won both the claim to fame
and a small claim to fame with fellow UoS alumni, with a yet-to-be decided expiration
date.

My original design:
<EasyImage imgFileName="eee-logo.png" style={{ width: '80%', margin: '.5rem auto' }} />

The final design after working with the University design team
<EasyImage imgFileName="eee-logo-final.png" style={{ width: '80%', margin: '.5rem auto' }} />
