This is an NPM package I wrote during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 and it served two purposes;
introduce me to publishing to NPM and to provide me with a break from my

  <a href="/my-work/space-thing">space-thing</a> project that I was also
  building out at the time.

I was working through a lot of Vector algebra with HTML5 canvas animations and was figuring out
how best to give the feel of depth on a screen / web page. I decided I could probably remake the star wars
acceleration to hyperspace animation pretty easily. So, I had a gaaod think and managed to produce this.
Itâ€™s since had a couple of minor upgrades but the base algorithm is much the same.

For each "star", I'm doing the following:

- Generate a random point in 3D space
  - Clamp X between 0 and half of the canvas width
  - Clamp Y between 0 and half of the canvas height
  - Z needs to be clamped between 0 and any number really, but I found using the max X works well
- Every frame / every time you redraw the star:
  - Instead of using just X and Y as the center of the star on the canvas, multiply both by (MAX_Z / Z)
  - Decrement Z

As Z moves approaches zero, the aforementioned coefficient (MAX_Z / Z) approaches infinity, meaning X and Y increase
and move towards the edge of the screen.

Then, once Z goes below zero, I "recycle" the star and reset it's coordinates, just to avoid continuously creating
new objects and leaving a load of memory waiting to be cleaned up.

export default ({ children }) => <MyWorkLayout>{children}</MyWorkLayout>;
