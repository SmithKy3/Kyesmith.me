Welcome to KyeSmith.me V3, a place for me to ramble about the things I'm building
when I'm not building the things that pay the bills (not that they aren't just as
fun).

Version one was my introduction to web development. I built it during my second year of
my undergraduate degree. It was a super basic, purely HTML and CSS, build that I got through
with the help of Codecademy. It was awful; completely unresponsive and horribly designed.
BUT I had built it and it was up on the web and, to be fair to myself, it was blazing fast
and even featured a parallax effect landing page (very fashionable at the time).
If I had any idea about SEO at the time, I likely could have gotten a great page ranking.

A few years later, I left Sheffield University and decided this little toe-dip into web development
was what I wanted to pursue and not a career in my degree field of Electronic Engineering.
I returned to my old friend Codecademy to learn the basics of JavaScript and PHP and started applying
to graduate schemes. Quite quickly, I landed a graduate JS developer role with Wren Kitchens at their
head office in Barton.
The 3 month training scheme there introduced me to TypeScript and React so I decided to branch out in
my own time and wrote V2 of this portfolio in Vue.js, using Nuxt to generate a static site so I could
continue using Github pages for hosting.

---

Now we're here and I've decided I like React much more than Vue. So, this current version is built using Next.JS,
styled-components, MDX and SASS. I did originally write and publish a version using Gatsby after using it
for an eCommerce build while working for 5874 commerce but I used Next for a personal project and much preferred it.

You can view the source code using the link at the top of the page if you're interested. You'll find that I try to
write a lot from scratch and this was a conscious decision / personal challenge while building this out. I didn't
want to lean on libraries for absolutely everything. A few good examples of this are; the site-wide dark mode / theme
switcher, the carousel on the homepage, the containers with the reactive shadows on the homepage
(they're much more interactive on a desktop) and also the debounce / throttle helper functions.
Anyway, thanks for reading, feel free to connect with me on Linkedin, comments / questions are always welcome!
