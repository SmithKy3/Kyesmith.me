Welcome to KyeSmith.me V3.

Version one was my introduction to web development; a super basic purely HTML and CSS build
that I wrote during my second year at university with the help of Codecademy. It was awful,
completely unresponsive and generally lacking in anything "exciting". BUT I had built it and it
was up on the web and, to be fair, it was blazing fast. If I had any idea about SEO at the time, I
likely could have gotten a great page ranking.

A few years later, I left Sheffield University and decided this was the most enjoyable area of my learning Iâ€™d had
while studying and it was completely outside of my course's scope, fantastic! Luckily, I had Codecademy to lean
on again and landed a graduate position as a JS dev with Wren Kitchens. After a while there being introduced to
TypeScript and React, I decided to branch out in my own time and wrote V2 in Vue.js, using Nuxt to generate a static
bundle. It was better, marginally.

Now we're here and I've decided I like React much more than Vue. So, this current version is built using Gatsby,
styled-components, SCSS and MDX. It's a nice stack for static site generation although I'm sure the MDX would become
a bit cumbersome for anything much more than a blog. You can view the source code using the link at the top of the page
if you're interested. You'll find that I try to write a lot of the components / logic from scratch and this was a conscious
decision / personal challenge while building this out. I didn't want to lean on libraries for absolutely everything.
A few good examples of this are; the site-wide dark mode / theme switcher, the carousel on the homepage, the containers
with the reactive shadows on the homepage (they're much more interactive on a desktop) and also the debounce / throttle
helper functions. Anyway, thanks for reading, feel free to connect with me on Linkedin, comments / questions are
always welcome!
