This little project began as a fun exercise in strengthening my vector algebra knowledge during the great
lockdown 1.0 of 2020. The original idea was to create a small universe sandbox of sorts that randomly generates
a few solar systems on page load. Each of these systems would consist of one star and one to “a few”
satellites / planets. When a system was spawned, it would have a starting velocity and direction and would be
orbiting the center of the screen. Then, chaos would slowly ensue as gravity took hold of each of the systems until
they all end in a lump in the center of the screen.

I didn’t get that far.

It turns out the intricacies of orbital mechanics require a degree in physics, at the very least,
for a very good reason; it’s complex. I did however manage to nail the calculations for a single
system’s orbits after spending a while looking into the spherical coordinate system and how to relate
this to the cartesian system. I still plan to re-join this project and build on my original
aims, but i’m allowing more career-centric skills to take precedence right now.

All of the mathematics / the engine handling the calculating and updating of positions was written
by myself and then it uses HTML5 canvas to draw & animate the whole scene. The whole thing is built on
top of a React app using Next.js and Vercel for hosting. A working demo is up and accessible via the link
at the top of this page. At the moment, a single star and satellite are generated and there’s a small
menu which allows some control over the satellite’s orbit.
