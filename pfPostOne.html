                <p class="postP">It seemed rather appropriate that the first peice of work to
                    talk about on here should be the website itself! I started
                    on this site in the middle of february 2017 and it's been
                    quite a learning curve as this has been my first time using
                    HTML. Everything I've learnt so far has been from either
                    <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>, or
                    from bugging my good friend, <a href="http://Jamesmilton.me">James</a>.
                    The whole thing is hosted on github pages for free
                    <a href="https://github.com/SmithKy3/Kyesmith.me">(here, take a gander)</a>,
                    and the domain name was free for a year with github's student
                    developer pack.
                    <br> I've been trying to write all of the code myself as
                    I wanted this website to be "homemade" in a sense, and I've,
                    generally, stuck to this. There are several "fancy" parts
                    of the site that I've used
                    <a href="https://Codepen.io">Codepen</a> for due to the
                    complexity of them/the use of javascript (which I haven't
                    taken the time to become accustom with... yet). These still
                    required some changes to get them working/customise them
                    though so it was fun to take a look at the code and it provided
                    some insight into higher level HTML and CSS.</p>
