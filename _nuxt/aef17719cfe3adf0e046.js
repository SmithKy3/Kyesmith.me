I use the spherical coordinate systemand 3D & 2D vectors to draw bodies onto a HTML5 canvas to draw bodies. I then\nupdate their position every frame based on the center of their orbit, the direction of their orbit and their velocity. The\naim is to keep working on it until it becomes somewhat of a universe sandbox, with the ability to add, remove and manipulate\nbodies or even entire solar systems. It's allowed me to delve into some physics which I enjoy more than I should, as well hone\nmy numeracy skills while i'm at it. It's also nice to do something that strays a little more towards game development than\nthe usual endless CSS of pure web development. I've written a little more about my inspiration and planned updates on the\ndemo page so take a gander and have a play."}}}),r=o(3),component=Object(r.a)(l,(function(){var e=this.$createElement;return(this._self._c||e)("portfolio-page",{attrs:{title:this.title,demoUrl:this.demoUrl,gitUrl:this.gitUrl,body:this.body}})}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
