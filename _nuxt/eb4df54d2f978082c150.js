I first got into coding in my first year at University. We had a module on C.\nWhile it was very basic (I believe the most complex it got was a command line calculator), it taught me some basics and ignited\nmy passion for it. I then went on to look into web development the next year and learnt HTML/CSS to build a simple static site\nthat I hosted on github pages (I used to use it pretty much for posting bits of photoshop work I had done and each time I wanted to add\na new entry to my "blog", I had to write and style a whole new page). The entire thing was hard coded and verbose and I would now coil up if I looked at the code, BUT\nI had made a website and it was on the internet and I was proud. Then University happened, I learnt little else in the way of programming\nbut I decided I wanted to chase it as a career option. So I took to CodeAcademy and applied like hell, and landed a position with Wren Kitchens\nin their first ever intake of graduate devlopers in August 2019. This involved 3 months of training and all being well, you "graduated" and was promoted\nto a Junior Developer. Fast forward a little more and furlough rolls round with COVID. "A great time to re-build a new portfolio website"\nsaid Kye, and here we are.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nWhile at work, I only use React, I decided to branch out a little with this new found time, and went for Vue, using NuxtJS as my dev platform\nand for building for easy static hosting on github pages. So far, I like vue alot. They make data-binding super easy and applying some\nfancy animations is a piece of cake straight out of the box, which I always find a little cumbersome with React. Do I prefer it over React? Unsure.\nI\'m certainly more comfortable with React but I put that down to experience more than anything. I definitely prefer the layout of Vue with their\nSingle File Components, with everything relating to a component being all neatly together, but that\'s acheivable in React with styled-components.\nI\'m hoping spending more time working on this will allow me to learn Vue some more and make a solid decision. But anyway, thanks for reading, there\'s\na link to the source code at the top of the page, feedback always welcome!'}}}),l=o(3),component=Object(l.a)(r,(function(){var e=this.$createElement;return(this._self._c||e)("portfolio-page",{attrs:{title:this.title,gitUrl:this.gitUrl,body:this.body}})}),[],!1,null,"373a744c",null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
