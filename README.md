# KyeSmith.me

This is a small portfolio site written (by me) in TypeScript, using React, SCSS modules, Vite and Three.js / React-Three-Fiber.
Feel free to take a look at the result at https://kyesmith.me

If, for some reason, you'd like to run it locally, simply clone the repo and run

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
