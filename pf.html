        <h1 id="title" class="animated zoomInDown">Welcome to my portfolio page!</h1>
        <br>
        <p id="intro">The intention is to, over time, fill this page with work from my degree
            course and with any projects i've taken up in my own time.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Kyesmith.me</h1>
        <p>It seemed rather appropriate that the first peice of work to talk about
            on here should be the website itself! I started on this site in
            the middle of february 2017 and it's been quite a learning curve
            as this has been my first time using HTML. Everything I've learnt
            so far has been from either <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>,
            or from bugging my good friend, <a href="http://Jamesmilton.me">James</a>.
            The whole thing is hosted on github pages for free
            <a href="https://github.com/SmithKy3/Kyesmith.me">(here, take a gander)</a>,
            and the domain name was free for a year with github's student developer
            pack.
            <br> I've been trying to write all of the code myself as I wanted
            this website to be "homemade" in a sense, and I've, generally, stuck
            to this. There are several "fancy" parts of the site that I've used
            <a href="https://Codepen.io">Codepen</a> for due to the complexity
            of them/the use of javascript (which I haven't taken the time to
            become accustom with... yet). These still required some changes
            to get them working/customise though though so it was fun to take
            a look at the code and it provided some insight into higher level
            HTML and CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Coming soon...</h1>
        <p>My final year project is currently ongoing and is based around using
            long wavelength (namely IR) photodiodes. At the minute, all I have
            are endless Excel spreadsheets of results and I'm unsure about the
            rules around posting this kind of stuff publicly. As soon as I've
            asked some questions and put some of the work together I'll be uploading
            it to here.</p>
