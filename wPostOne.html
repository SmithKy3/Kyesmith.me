                <p class="postP">As I've been building this website, I seem to have inherited
                    a much larger appetite for creation; a need to satiate a
                    deep hunger for "making stuff".
                    <br> So, natuarally, I turned to photoshop. Now, photoshop
                    is a bit of software that I've always fancied getting myself
                    accquainted with (to anyone feeling the same way; do it).
                    However, It's something I've never taken the necessary time
                    out for. Until now obviously.
                    <br>I decided a fun first project would be just trying to
                    "cartoonise" a photo of someone, that lucky someone being
                    my girlfriend Rachel (I'm sure she'll be super pleased this
                    is getting uploaded).
                    <br>
                    <img src="Rach1_COM.jpg" id="rach1">
                    <br> This first attempt was a little rough as I hadn't yet
                    become accquainted with any of the tools really.
                    <br>So I tried again. And I'd discovered the pen tool (and
                    the fill bucket... took a while I know).
                    <br>
                    <img src="Rach2_COM.png" id="rach2">
                    <br>I feel this one came out a lot better, although I'm
                    pretty pleased with the pair considering these were my first
                    two times ever even opening photoshop.
                    <br>The next time I wanted to change it up a bit, and I
                    wanted to get something made in a relatively short time.
                    This is what I came up with:
                    <br>
                    <img src="de_COM.png" id="de">
                    <br>I got the inspiration from <a href="http://daneden.me">Daniel Eden</a>                    and his generative art. My process for creating this involved
                    no such loveliness however. It was simple a doodle drawn
                    with the brush tool and then 50 layers of the same shape,
                    each layer 4% smaller than the previous. Not especially
                    fun, but a nice, trippy, light-speed, tunnel-esque result.
                    <br>Thanks for reading.</p>
