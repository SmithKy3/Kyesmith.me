		<p>I'm a third year at the University of Sheffield, studying Electronic Engineering. This website is a little bit of a hobby project for me and will be the guinea pig for my first time using HTML. In the near future, the site should become a lot more advanced
			and a wee bit prettier. The plan is to show things such as my CV, email, portfolio and whatever other cool 'n' hip 'n' swag 'n' phat things I decide to throw in. Maybe the odd cat video. I don't know.
