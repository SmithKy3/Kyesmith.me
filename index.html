		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/sNPnbI1arSE?t=9">My name is</a> Kye Smith.</h2> 
		<p>I'm a third year at the University of Sheffield, studying Electronic Engineering.
		This website is a little bit of a hobby project for me and will be the guinea pig 
		for my first time using HTML.
		In the near future, the site should become a lot more advanced and a wee bit prettier.  
		The plan is to show things such as my CV, email, portfolio and whatever other cool 'n' 
		hip 'n' swag 'n' phat things I decide to throw in. Maybe the odd cat video. I don't know.
